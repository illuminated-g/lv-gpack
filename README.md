# lv-gpack
Dependency management tooling for LabVIEW.

Most of GPack is automating source code control interactions in a way that keeps LabVIEW happy. No centralized package install locations, no enforced project layouts, and just 1 `.gpack` file in your repository to persist dependency information for code that lives outside your project.

It's your source code control operations, streamlined.
